/**
 * Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing a Room along with its associated Beds.
 *
 * This DTO is specifically used in admin-level views where detailed room data,
 * including its beds, is requiredâ€”such as in the "Manage Room" tab of the Admin Dashboard.
 *
 * This class aggregates both room-level metadata and a list of simplified `BedDTO` objects.
 * It supports frontend display requirements like showing room info and associated bed numbers in popups.
 *
 * Lombok annotations (@Getter and @Setter) automatically generate getters and setters for all fields.
